Coding projects for use in a Windows network settings.

* WMIAssetAudit(or QDAudit) is my first attempt at using WinForms.  The application connects to a list of servers, gathers their
    asset tag and serial number information, then displays that information.

    To do list:
    * Add a default view to the display grid.
    * Add functionality so that servers can be connected to by copying and pasting computer names directly in the grid.
    * Add an exit event handler.
    * Clean up the file dialog box so that only files with the .txt extention show.
